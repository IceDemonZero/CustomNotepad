# CustomNotepad
This program is for taking notes. It uses the swing GUI so it looks a bit dated. The program can perform basic note taking program functions such as creating a new file, opening .txt files, saving files and undoing and redoing text. You can use CTRL-Z to undo text and CTRL-Y to redo text.

## Prerequistes
None besides java

## Installing
Just copy or download. There is an executable jar if you just wanna use the program itself

# Java version
Made in version 1.8 IIRC
